<h2>HISTORY OF VEDIC MATHS :</h2>

<h6 id="main">Vedic Mathematics is a collection of ancient tricks and techniques to execute arithmetic operations quickly and more efficiently. 
Vedic Math comes from the Vedas, more specifically the Atharva Veda.
 It was revived by Indian mathematician Jagadguru Shri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji between 1911 and 1918. He then published this work in a book called Vedic Mathematics in 1965. It comprises 16 sutras (formulae) and 13 sub sutras.
 The history of Vedic Mathematics is traditionally divided into two periods: the Early Vedic Period and the Later Vedic Period.

</h6>

<h2> Early Vedic Period (Approximately 1500 BCE - 800 BCE):</h2>



<h3 id="subheading">Origin in the Vedas: </h3>
<p id="normal">The foundations of Vedic Mathematics are said to be found in the religious and philosophical texts of the Early Vedic Period, particularly in the Rigveda. The Rigveda contains hymns that are believed to contain the seed of mathematical concepts and principles..</p>

<h3 id="subheading">Sulba Sutras</h3>
<p id="normal">The Sulba Sutras, which are part of the Vedic literature, provide explicit instructions for the construction of ritual altars, involving geometric and mathematical principles. These sutras are among the earliest sources of mathematical knowledge in ancient India.</p>

<h3 id="subheading">Decimal System: </h3>
<p id="normal">The early Vedic people are credited with the development of a decimal system, which laid the groundwork for more advanced mathematical concepts in the Later Vedic Period. The decimal system is evident in the use of place value notation in Vedic texts.</p>


<h2> Later Vedic Period (Approximately 800 BCE - 200 BCE):</h2>

<h3 id="subheading">Introduction of More Advanced Concepts: </h3>
<p id="normal">The mathematical concepts found in the Early Vedic Period continued to evolve and become more sophisticated in the Later Vedic Period. Mathematical ideas were further developed in texts such as the Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.</p>

<h3 id="subheading">Sulba Sutras Continued: </h3>
<p id="normal">The Sulba Sutras continued to play a significant role in the Later Vedic Period. Mathematicians used these texts to explore geometric principles, including rules for constructing altars of various shapes and sizes.</p>

<h3 id="subheading">Katapayadi System: </h3>
<p id="normal">The Katapayadi system, a unique method of encoding numbers using consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet, emerged during this period. This system is related to the later development of Vedic Numerical Codes.</p>

<h3 id="subheading">Mathematics in Other Texts: </h3>
<p id="normal">Mathematical concepts can be found in various other Vedic texts, including the Brahmanas and Upanishads, reflecting the integration of mathematical thinking into religious and philosophical discourse.</p>


<h2> Post-Vedic Period::</h2>

<p id="normal">After the Vedic Period, mathematical ideas continued to evolve in subsequent periods, with notable contributions from scholars like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara. These mathematicians made significant advancements in areas such as algebra, trigonometry, and astronomy, building upon the foundation laid during the Vedic era.

It's important to note that while Vedic Mathematics has historical significance, the modern system of mathematics used globally has evolved independently and incorporates contributions from various cultures and civilizations. Vedic Mathematics, as a distinct system, gained renewed interest in the 20th century with the efforts of scholars like Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha, who sought to revive and promote these ancient mathematical techniques.
